# CodeSinaia2023
Developed a project focusing on the implementation of communication protocols to facilitate efficient and reliable data transfer.
# Programming Camp Summary

## Overview
During this programming camp, I participated in a series of presentations and practical sessions that helped deepen my understanding of core programming concepts, cybersecurity basics, shell scripting, and effective code management using GitHub. The camp concluded with a challenging problem-solving project, **Tablets of Stone**, which simulated real-world data communication protocols.

## Topics Covered

### Basics of Java
Introduced foundational concepts in Java, including syntax, control structures, and basic data types, laying a solid foundation for more complex topics.

### References in Java
Explored how Java handles data references, including memory allocation, object manipulation, and differences between primitive types and reference types.

### Multidimensional Arrays
Learned to use and manipulate multidimensional arrays for storing complex data structures, enhancing understanding of memory layout and data organization in Java.

### File IO Fundamentals
Covered file input and output basics in Java, understanding how to create, read, write, and manage file data in applications.

### File IO Read and Write
Delved into more advanced file handling, focusing on efficient data management through buffered streams and handling file exceptions.

### GitHub
Practiced using GitHub for version control, including commands for creating repositories, committing changes, branching, and collaborating on code through pull requests.

### Intro to Cybersecurity
Discussed key cybersecurity principles, including data protection, common security threats, and the importance of secure coding practices.

### The Power of Shell
Explored shell scripting and command-line tools, learning how to navigate the file system, automate tasks, and manage files more effectively using the terminal.

## Project: Tablets of Stone

In the final project, **Tablets of Stone**, we tackled a problem inspired by data communication protocols used on the internet. Hereâ€™s a summary:

- **Context**: Set in an ancient city, Governors communicated via messages on stone tablets, each carrying limited information. The goal was to develop reliable communication rules to prevent data loss or errors.
- **Objective**: Design a protocol for the Governors to ensure messages reached their destination accurately, despite potential disruptions from messengers.
- **Learning Outcome**: This project demonstrated real-world networking challenges, emphasizing the importance of packet structure, error-checking, and data ordering, akin to protocols like TCP and UDP.

In this project, tablets represented data packets with finite space. We balanced data and header information, managed packet ordering, and added error-checking techniques to simulate a reliable communication protocol. This hands-on experience highlighted how internet protocols maintain efficient data transfer despite channel unreliability.
